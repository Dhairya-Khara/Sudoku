# Sudoku Visualizer
The motivation of this project came from [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim)'s sudoku visualizer. The primary purpose of this code was to deepen my 
understanding of the Python programming language and the backtracking algorithm. 
Even though [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim) uses a recursive approach to build his backtracking algorithm, an interative procedure is used in this project.
Not only is this algorithm being used to solve sudoku boards, but I use it generate unique sudoku puzzles. Both the algorithms (generator and solver) have been implemented
using raw Python and visuzlied using Pygame. Other thid party modules is pygame_menu, to organize the user interface.
